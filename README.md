# Plastic Recycling Incentive System

A blockchain-based platform that rewards citizens for collecting and recycling plastic through token incentives, contributing to environmental sustainability while creating economic opportunities.

## Overview

The Plastic Recycling Incentive System leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, efficient, and rewarding ecosystem for plastic waste collection and recycling. By tokenizing rewards and verifying collection events, the system incentivizes participation in environmental conservation efforts.

### Market Context

- **Market Size**: Global plastic waste recycling market valued at $50 billion
- **Growth Rate**: Incentive programs growing at 20% annually
- **Impact**: Addressing the global plastic pollution crisis through economic incentives

### Real-World Application

In Southeast Asia, over 10 million participants are actively collecting approximately 500 tons of plastic waste daily, earning cryptocurrency rewards for their environmental contributions. This model demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of blockchain-based incentive systems in waste management.

## Features

### Waste Collection Coordinator Contract

The `waste-collection-coordinator` smart contract provides:

- **Collection Event Recording**: Immutable logging of plastic collection activities with weight verification
- **Quality Validation**: Automated plastic quality assessment to ensure recyclability standards
- **Reward Distribution**: Transparent and automated token reward system based on collection metrics
- **Environmental Impact Tracking**: Real-time monitoring and reporting of environmental benefits

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts

- **waste-collection-coordinator.clar**: Core contract managing the entire lifecycle of plastic collection, validation, reward distribution, and impact measurement

### Technology Stack

- **Blockchain Platform**: Stacks (Bitcoin Layer 2)
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity
- **Development Framework**: Clarinet

## Benefits

### For Collectors
- Earn cryptocurrency rewards for environmental action
- Transparent tracking of contributions
- Instant reward distribution
- Verifiable collection history

### For Recyclers
- Quality-assured plastic material supply
- Transparent sourcing and chain of custody
- Reduced operational costs through automation
- Data-driven decision making

### For Environment
- Measurable reduction in plastic pollution
- Incentivized participation in recycling efforts
- Transparent impact reporting
- Scalable solution for global adoption

## Use Cases

1. **Community Collection Programs**: Local communities organizing plastic collection drives with automated reward systems
2. **Corporate ESG Initiatives**: Companies supporting environmental programs with transparent impact tracking
3. **Municipal Waste Management**: Cities implementing blockchain-based recycling incentive programs
4. **Educational Programs**: Schools teaching environmental responsibility through gamified collection systems
